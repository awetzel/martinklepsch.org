## Goal

Write some simple Clojure application that fetches the followers of a set of twitter users
in a certain interval of time.
Provide the data via a RESTful JSON API and graph it in the browser with
[raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/).

## Steps

1. Setup Clojure web application
2. Find a way to make Twitter API calls with that
3. Map this to own API
