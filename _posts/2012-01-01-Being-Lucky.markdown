On 16 July 2010 I graduated from college. My overall experience there was great. I never
worked hard for school and managed it to not mess it up. It was a typical example for the
[80-20 rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). Long before I graduated
I decided to study computer science in Berlin. I was into this for quite some time after
discovering the endless possibilities the internet offers. Back then a friend and I tried
to build up a gallery with pictures of street art in our area. We never got that done but we
learned tons of stuff on the way.

When I stark



























finishing school without working for it
going to berlin, joining cct
meeting the right people (frane)
learning rails
meeting even more of the right people (stefan, nina, cct-crowd)
living in berlin
