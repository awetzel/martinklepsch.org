Martin Klepsch is a young web developer from Berlin, Germany.<br>
Beside backend programming Martin is also interested in many aspects of application
development like user interaction design. In all areas Martin is striving to find the
simplest possible solution to a problem.

When Martin is not working on any of these serious things he enjoys longboarding and partying. Sometimes beerpong.

## Colophon
This site was coded mostly by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).
It is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and uses Github Pages for static hosting.
Text is set in [Arvo](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Arvo),
served by [Google webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

I used the [Skeleton framework](http://getskeleton.com) to have a basic grid system and
a responsive design across different screen resolutions.
