Hi I'm Martin! I am young web developer from Berlin, Germany.<br>
Beside backend programming I'm also interested in many aspects of application
development like user interaction design. I usually tend to think a lot about those things
even if I am not in a position where this is a requirement.
I like to solve problems with their simplest possible solution.

When I'm not working I'm mostly [reading](http://www.readability.com/mklappstuhl/archives)
or hanging out with [friends](http://facebook.com/martinklepsch).

## Colophon
This site was coded mostly by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).
It is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and uses Amazon S3 for static hosting.
Text is set in [Arvo](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Arvo),
served by [Google webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

I used the [Skeleton framework](http://getskeleton.com) to have a basic grid system and
a responsive design across different screen resolutions.

Some parts of this website are not implemented respecting best-practices. The reasons for
this are a) I don't care because I don't sell anything and b) I like to play with stuff.
