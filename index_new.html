Hi, my name is Martin Klepsch and I guess people would call this place something like my
online presence. I am a young (1231 days / 20.34 yrs) guy who lives in the wonderful Berlin.
I sometimes like to refer to myself as professional dreamer. I dropped out of college
6 weeks after starting. While originally coming discovering the Internet from a more
creative perspective I now mostly mold business logic into server-side code. My interests in
design stayed though which makes me an opinionated person about everything design-related.
In fact I am probably an opinionated person about everything.
